# Parsing multipolygons

Processes WKT ([Well-known text](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/)) multipolygon files into individual polygons.

* **multipolygons.txt** contains two polygons (the code can process files of much larger sizes, but github does not allow for uploads larger than 25mb) which serve as a simple example of the code's functionality. The two are admistrative boundaries of Indonesia's provinces.
